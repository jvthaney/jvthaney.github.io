				<!-- About Me Section -->
                <section id="AboutMe" class="spotlight style1 orient-left content-align-left image-position-center onscroll-image-fade-in">
                    <div class="content">
                        <h2>About me</h2>
                        <p> I am an interdisciplinary aquatic ecologist with a passion for studying freshwater ecosystems by combining diverse approaches.
                            I use a wide range of tools from disciplines including ecology, ecotoxicology, and remote sensing, to investigate 
                            ecological questions related to aquatic food webs, cyanobacteria, cyanotoxins, and lake water quality.  
                            <br><br>
                            A central theme of my research is understanding how cyanobacteria and their toxins influence freshwater
                            food webs and the surrounding terrestrial landscape. I am also interested in improving our understanding of the
                            multiple potential routes of exposure to cyanotoxins in the environment, through processes such as bioaccumulation and freshwater aerosolization.
                            In addition to studying lakes in the northeast,
                            some of my research addresses these questions in polar ecosystems, where
                            lakes and ponds are experiencing climate-related changes such as shifts in ice cover duration, precipitation,
                            and melting permafrost.
                            <br><br>
                            Outside of science, I am also a dancer trained in tap, jazz, modern, and aerial dance and have
                            enjoyed performing in shows across the seacoast region.
                            I have been the tap instructor at <a href="http://thedancecollectivenh.com/"
                            target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color:black;"><i>The Dance Collective</i></a> in 
                            West Lebanon, NH since 2015, and a member of the <a href="https://hop.dartmouth.edu/live-events/ensembles/dartmouth-dance-ensemble"
                            target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color:black;"><i>Dartmouth Dance Ensemble</i></a> a since 2016. I have always loved merging
                            science with the arts. I enjoy thinking about ways in which biology can inform choreography, and how movement can be used as a form of data visualization 
                            (e.g., <a href="https://president.dartmouth.edu/events/event?event=69860#.ZDVpHxXMKek" target="_blank" class="hyperlink" style="color:black">Biomimetic Choreography workshop</a>). 
                            I think the two disciplines can inspire creative approaches and new perspectives in each other.

                        <br>
                        <p>Satellite data allow us to examine water quality at much broader spatial scales and higher temporal resolutions than is
                            possible with in-lake sampling alone.
                            My work pairs <i>in situ</i> lake measurements with satellite imagery to develop predictive models of water quality in
                            lakes. I am interested in tracking how changes in metrics such as chlorophyll-<i>a</i>, temperature, and other water quality metrics vary at
                            different temporal scales, ranging from within a season to across decades.  
                            I also ask questions about how these parameters vary spatially within a lake - e.g., 
                            do blooms occur predictably in certain areas of the lake, and is that changing through time?
                            <br><br>
                            To work towards improving predictions of cyanobacterial abundance, I am also working on a project pairing satellite imagery with measurements of cyanobacteria-specific pigments and
                            several cyanotoxins. As part of this collaborative project, I am striving to develop more robust models that can use satellite imagery to more accurately predict not only cyanobacteria abundance,
                            but cyanotoxin conditions. 
                            This project (SICM: Satellite-Integrated Cyanobacterial Monitoring) is a collaboration with 
                            researchers at the <a href="http://cfb.unh.edu/" target="_blank" id="CFB" class="hyperlink" style="color:black"> University of New Hampshire</a>,

                        <br>
                        <p>Cyanobacteria and the toxins they produce are a major concern worldwide for their harmful effects on human and environmental health.
                            A major focus of my work has been investigating the transfer and
                            accumulation of cyanotoxins in underinvestigated systems such as aquatic food webs in arctic and alpine lakes.
                            I have found that cyanotoxins in these systems 
                            can be transferred within multiple components of the benthic and pelagic food webs. I am especially interested in exploring
                            how cyanotoxins are transferred between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, through mechanisms such as emerging
                            insects, transfer through plants, and aerosolization. I am currently looking at which mechanisms of cyanotoxin transfer 
                            are occurring in Loon Pond, an alpine lake in northern New Hampshire.

                        <br>
                        <p>Aerosolization of cyanobacteria and their toxins represents a potentially important route of toxin exposure and a potential mechanism of dispersal 
                            of cyanobacterial cells across landscapes, yet the environmental factors driving bioaerosol production in freshwater systems are not yet well described.
                            I am working on developing techniques for capturing and quantifying aerosolized cells from aquatic and terrestrial substrates
                            in temperate and polar regions to improve our understanding of how cyanobacterial cells and toxins may be transported by this process. I also use 
                            controlled laboratory and mesocosm experiments to tease apart the potential environmental (e.g., temperature, humidiity) and biological (e.g., composition of the food web)
                            mechanisms influencing aerosolization rates.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>In many polar lakes and ponds, benthic cyanobacteria represent an important component of the ecosystem. While many high latitude systems
                            lack conspicuous surface blooms, cyanobacteria are often abundant and productive at the bottom of the lake, thriving
                            as benthic mats and multicellular colonies on the benthos.
                            I am interested in the role benthic communites play in these ecosystems, especially
                             the extent to which they contribute cyanotoxins to the aquatic food web.
                             <br><br>My research on cyanobacteria of the genus <i>Nostoc</i> (also known as "sea tomatoes") 
                              in Greenlandic lakes, where they can be extremely abundant, has shown that benthic colonies contain cyanotoxins and may be important in releasing these toxins
                              into aquatic ecosystems. Benthic cyanobacteria are not limited to polar environments and I am also interested in how toxin production varies in
                              benthic communities in temperate lakes. </p>

                    <h1>Teaching</h1>
                    <p> Teaching is one of the most fun and rewarding aspects of being a scientist. I have taught many courses between Dartmouth College and Colby-Sawyer College,
                        including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Field Methods in Ecology</li>
                            <li>Physiological Ecology</li>
                            <li>Aquatic Ecology</li>
                            <li>Water Resources</li>
                            <li>Soil and Water Chemistry</li>
                            <li>Introduction to Environmental Science</li>
                            <li>Anatomy and Physiology</li>
                         </ul> 
                        My courses often involve a field component as I love bringing students outdoors to experience the excitement of natural processes firsthand, and
                        to practice practical research methods in the field.
                        <br><br> I also participate in teaching several intensive field courses abroad, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://guarini.dartmouth.edu/programs/biological-sciences-fsp" class="hyperlink" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(18, 55, 1)">
                                <b>Biology Foreign Studies Program (Bio FSP)</b></a>: this is an immersive tropical field ecology course that brings students to biological field stations throughout
                            Costa Rica and the Cayman Islands where they experience some of the most biologically diverse ecosystems on earth, learning about tropical ecology and conducting research projects in each unique habitat</li>
                            <li><a href="https://sites.google.com/dartmouth.edu/jsep2020" class="hyperlink" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color:rgb(18, 55, 1)">
                                <b>Joint Science Education Program (JSEP)</b></a>: this is an NSF-funded highly collaborative project between researchers and educators in Greenland, Denmark and the United states 
                                that brings high schoolers from these three countries to Greenland to learn about the Arctic and to inspire and train the next generation of polar researchers </li>
                        </ul> 
                        I also enjoy mentoring many undergraduate student research projects and I am always looking for enthusiastic students to assist me with research in the lab and in the field.
                    <br><br>
                    </p>
                     <h1 class="">Outreach</h1>
                     <p> Every person should get the chance to participate in science and research and
                         I learn a great deal from the perspectives and contributions from community members. 
                         I enjoy engaging with community scientists through hands-on research, lake monitoring projects, community events, and open forums. I contribute to training community scientists and water quality managers in lake monitoring techniques 
                         through the <a href="https://cyanos.org/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color: black" class="hyperlink"><b>Cyanobacterial Monitoring Collaborative (CMC)</b></a>
                         and through local lake associations.
             
                         <br><br> I am currently working with 
                         the <a href="https://www.lakesunapee.org/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none;color: black" class="hyperlink"><b>Lake Sunapee Protective Association (LSPA)</b> </a> 
                         to develop a community science cyanobacteria monitoring program <a href="https://www.lakesunapee.org/about-cyanoscope" class="hyperlink" style="text-decoration:none;color:black">
                            <b>(CyanoScope)</b>.</a> This program trains community members how to collect, count, and identify key types of cyanobacteria
                         in the lake using customized sampling kits and counting protocols (check out the

                         The resulting data are helping us track changes in the abundance and composition of cyanobacteria in Lake Sunapee. Additionally, the community scientists
                         sample on days with known satellite overpasses to enable pairing of the in-situ data with satellite imagery, which I'm using to improve algorithms for remotely sensing
                         cyanobacterial abundance in the lake (see <a class="hyperlink" style="text-decoration:none;color: black;" href="#Research">Research Interests</a>). </p>
